## Estimation of angle
In this simulation, our goal is to estimate the angle of the reflected signal, denoted as beta. To achieve this, we simulate a plot of the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for $\beta$. We investigate how the CRLB changes in relation to the length of the array, the number of arrays, the wavelength, and the sensitivity of the CRLB to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

This simulation is based on Example 3-15 from the book "Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Estimation Theory" by Steven M. Kay.
