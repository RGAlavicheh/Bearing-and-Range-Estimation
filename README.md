# Bearing-Estimation
## Estimation of angle
In this simulation, our goal is to estimate the angle of the reflected signal, denoted as beta. To achieve this, we simulate a plot of the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for beta. We investigate how the CRLB changes in relation to the length of the array, the number of arrays, the wavelength, and the sensitivity of the CRLB to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
