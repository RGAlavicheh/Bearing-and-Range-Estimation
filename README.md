# Bearing-Estimation
## Estimation of angle
In this simulation, our goal is to estimate the angle of the reflected signal, denoted as $\beta$. To achieve this, we simulate a plot of the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for $\beta$. We investigate how the CRLB changes in relation to the length of the array, the number of arrays, the wavelength, and the sensitivity of the CRLB to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
